        <div class="about-text">
        <p>Hi, my name is Helen.</p>
        <p>I’m a junior at the University of Michigan’s School of Information studying Information Science with a concentration in User Experience Design.</p>
        <p>I began my undergraduate studies at Western Washington University with the intention of pursuing medicine. As an Asian American, there is constant pressure from parents to make decisions that ensure financial stability and occupational prestige. Consequently, I find that creativity is highly undervalued within my ethnic community due to its association with a disorderly lifestyle. Choosing medicine had been a satisfying choice in a way, since I’ve always wanted to directly contribute to and improve the lives of others.</p>
        <p>A personal finance class I took the summer following my freshman year gradually shifted my academic path: in our analysis of stock market trends, I was in awe of the immense economic and social impact of tech companies on a global scale. Months later, I discovered a renewed sense of passion and purpose within myself, with the field that would allow me to both pursue my affinity for creativity and satisfy the desire for my work to have communal impact: user experience design.</p>
        <p>This fall, I transferred to the School of Information at the University of Michigan, where I am now pursuing  a Bachelor of Science in Information on the User Experience Design path.</p>
